Create new backend with base-dn and creating the default necessary indexes. 
Call the script with createBaseDn argument to additionally create base-dn, call the script without arguments, 
this will create only backend and indexes.
Base-dn is only needed on the first server (base-dn will be replicated to other servers after successfully created on the first one).

Change any settings at the top of the script to meet your installation needs section # settings.
Besides the creation of the backend the script will create the default indexes with default values.
The default index type will be equality with default index-entry-limit:4000.
In the end, the script rebuilds each index separately.
You can add or remove indexes to be created by editting the script in section # settings
INDEXES=("cn" "mail" "ds-certificate-subject-dn" "ds-certificate-fingerprint" "uid")
Also you can change the type of index in INDEXTYPE=equality and INDEXENTRYLIMIT=4000
enjoy!
